# Intel_edge_women_who_code_project
#women_who_code channel specific project for Intel Edge OpenVINO toolkits deployment and learning.

# Mini-Project Idea
## Object Detection and classification as Person or not! 

### Part 1
Using a Pre-trained model provided in OpenVINO toolkit and deploy it in edge. (Getting the basics strong, and revising and practicing the Udacity Intel Edge Scholarship Challenge Phase - 1, course content.)

### Part 2 
Building PyTorch Model from Scratch for the same.

## Future Scope : 
Turn it into a main project with more advanced features such as object detection and classification as - person, cat, pen, ball, car, etc.
